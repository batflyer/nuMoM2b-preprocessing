Categorical Screening Questions
===============================

This config files extracts results of screening questions asked during the
screening interview. Most of these are the sort of questions which would
be asked in a clinical setting, but also might be filled in by a patient.

``"csv_path"`` and ``"target.name"`` may need to be adjusted depending on
file locations on your specific machine.
