nuMoM2b_preprocessing
=====================

A Python package for pre-processing ``nuMoM2b`` data with configuration files.

This is one component within a wider research project for predicting adverse events
over the course of a woman's pregnancy. This package serves the dual role of assisting
with pre-processing tasks and for producing reproducible partitions of the data based
on configuration files.

`Writing Configuration Files <first_config.html>`_
--------------------------------------------------

Configuration files define which variables should be used and how they should be
aggregated. This is a worked example for writing a configuration file.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "csv_path": "../FullData/numom_data/",
      "target": {
          "name": "Ancillary/Pregnancy_outcomes.csv",
          "variables": ["PublicID", "oDM"]
      },
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "Screening_Admin_Visits/Visit1.csv",
          "variables": ["PublicID", "V1BA01_KG", "V1BA01_LB"]
        }
      ]
    }
